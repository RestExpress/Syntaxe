Syntaxe is an annotations-based, functional-style syntactic (and semantic) domain model validation
framework for Java.

Created to be simple, Syntaxe supports the following:
1) @Validate (annotation) - which supports required, less-than, greater-than validations on fields.
2) Functional-style closures that allow users to create additional custom validations,
   whether syntactic or semantic.
3) Validatable interface which calls out the validation contract.
4) AbstractValidatable which is the default implementation of Validatable, which supports the
   use of @Validate and functional validations.
5) Validations utility class containing foreign methods to perform your own default validations
   such as requiredness, less-than, greater-than.
6) Validator utility class that implements validation on an instance that leverages the 
   @Validiate annotation.
